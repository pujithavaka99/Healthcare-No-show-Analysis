# Medical Appointment No-Show Analysis

## About the Project
Missed medical appointments create problems for both hospitals and patients. They waste resources, increase waiting times, and reduce the quality of care.

In this project, I analyzed a medical appointment dataset to understand **why patients miss their appointments** and what factors influence no-shows. The goal was to uncover patterns and provide practical recommendations that healthcare providers can use to reduce missed visits.

## Key Questions
- What is the overall no-show rate?
- Do SMS reminders help reduce missed appointments?
- Which age groups miss appointments more often?
- Are there daily trends in no-shows?

---

## Tools Used
- **Python** – data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- **SQL** – querying and aggregating data
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboard and visual insights

## Key Insights
- Around **1 in 5 appointments** result in a no-show.
- **Younger patients** are more likely to miss appointments.
- **SMS reminders** help reduce no-show rates.
- Some days show **higher spikes in missed appointments**, suggesting scheduling or operational issues.

---

## Recommendations
- Send automated reminders to high-risk patient groups.
- Provide extra follow-ups for younger patients.
- Monitor and adjust schedules on high no-show days.
- Use predictive models to identify likely no-shows in advance.
